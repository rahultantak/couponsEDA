Assignment details
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not.

Key Findings:
1. Overall Acceptance Rate: Approximately 50% of coffee house coupons were accepted.
2. Coffee House Visitation Frequency: Drivers who visit coffee houses more than 3 times/month show a significantly higher acceptance rate ~67% compared to those who visit 3 or fewer times/month ~44%. This indicates that frequent visitors are much more receptive.
3. Passenger Type: Acceptance rates are highest when the driver has Friend(s) ~60% or a Partner ~57% as passengers. Acceptance is lower when driving Alone ~43% or with Kid(s) ~47%. This suggests a social aspect to coffee coupon acceptance.
4. Destination: Coupons are more likely to be accepted when the destination is No Urgent Place ~58% or Work ~44%, and least likely when heading Home ~36%. This implies that coupons are more effective during commutes or leisure activities.
5. Age: Younger drivers, particularly those below21 ~68% and 21 years old ~52%, show the highest acceptance rates. The acceptance rate generally decreases with increasing age.
6. Time of Day: Acceptance rates peak at 10AM ~63% and 2PM ~54%, aligning with typical morning and afternoon coffee breaks.
7. Weather: Rainy weather ~52% acceptance shows a slightly higher acceptance rate than Sunny ~50% or Snowy ~43% conditions, possibly due to a desire for a warm beverage.
8. Gender: There is no significant difference in acceptance rates between Female ~49% and Male ~50% drivers.
